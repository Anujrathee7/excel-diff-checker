## Introduction
This is a simple java tool to check diff between two excel files.

## Prerequisites
Java 8+

## Usage
java -jar excel-diff-checker.jar \<File1-path> \<File2-path> [-r] [-s \<Comma-separated sheet-names>]-> where File1 and File2 are mandatory, options: 'r' & 's' are optional.

## Notes to follow
 - This tool is not having any complex algorithm to check diff, so won't be able to detect column/row addition/deletion.
 - It basically considers File1 as base, and checks for diff cell-by-cell in File2, even for sheets too.
 - By default, it adds cell comments/note saying like 'Expected: value1, Found: value2' in a copy of File1 excel and produces it as a different result file.
 - Instead of above, if only remarks required about different cell diffs i.e. no separate result file required, in that case, the option: 'r' can be used, which just prints the diff note as mentioned in above point, in the console output and not as cell comment of a new file.
 - By using option 's', we can compare specific sheets only.
